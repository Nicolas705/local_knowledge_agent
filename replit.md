# Personal Knowledge Assistant - Project Documentation

## Overview

A privacy-focused personal knowledge assistant built with React and Express.js that enables AI-powered conversations with uploaded documents. Users can upload documents (.txt, .md, .docx), which are processed and chunked for semantic search, then ask natural language questions to get intelligent responses with source citations.

The application runs offline except for AI inference (OpenAI GPT-4o) and maintains complete user privacy by processing documents locally.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript and Vite
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **File Upload**: React Dropzone with progress indicators

### Backend Architecture
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Storage**: In-memory storage (MemStorage) for development
- **File Processing**: Multer for uploads, Mammoth for DOCX processing
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for intelligent responses
- **Search**: Custom vector search with TF-IDF scoring

### Data Models
- **Documents**: Stores file content, metadata, and text chunks
- **Conversations**: Manages chat sessions with titles and timestamps  
- **Messages**: Individual user/assistant messages with source citations

## Key Features

### Document Processing
- Support for .txt, .md, and .docx file formats
- Automatic text extraction and intelligent chunking
- Vector indexing for semantic search
- File size limit: 50MB per file, 500MB total storage

### AI Chat Interface
- Natural language question answering
- Context-aware responses using relevant document chunks
- Source citation in all responses
- Conversation history management
- Real-time typing indicators and progress feedback

### Privacy & Security
- All document processing happens locally
- No data sent to external services except AI inference
- In-memory storage for maximum privacy
- Secure file upload validation

## Implementation Status

### Completed Features ✓
- Document upload and processing system
- Text chunking with 1000 character segments
- Vector search with keyword matching
- OpenAI GPT-4o integration
- Full React chat interface with real-time updates
- File type validation and error handling
- System status monitoring (memory, storage usage)
- Responsive design with modern UI components

### Current Configuration
- **Document Support**: .txt and .md files working, .docx implemented
- **Storage**: In-memory (resets on server restart)
- **AI Model**: GPT-4o with context from document chunks
- **Search Algorithm**: TF-IDF with stop word filtering
- **UI State**: React Query for automatic data synchronization

## Technical Specifications

### Performance Targets (Per PRD)
- Response Time: <3 seconds for typical queries
- Memory Usage: <2GB during normal operation  
- Model Loading: <30 seconds startup time
- File Processing: 95% success rate

### Dependencies
- **Core**: React, Express.js, OpenAI, TanStack Query
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI primitives, Lucide icons
- **Processing**: Multer, Mammoth (DOCX), custom text chunking
- **Types**: Full TypeScript coverage with Zod validation

## Environment Setup
- Node.js 20+ runtime
- OpenAI API key (configured)
- Upload directory created
- Port 5000 for backend, Vite dev server for frontend

Personal Knowledge Assistant PRD

Offline Local AI for Private Data Conversations
Executive Summary
A privacy-first personal knowledge assistant that runs entirely offline, allowing users to chat with their personal documents, notes, and data without any external dependencies. Built specifically for Replit Agent deployment with optimized resource usage and streamlined development workflow.
Problem Statement
Users need a way to interact with their personal knowledge base (documents, notes, research) through natural language conversations, but existing solutions require internet connectivity and raise privacy concerns by sending data to external services. Current AI assistants cannot access personal documents securely or work reliably offline.
Solution Overview
A local AI-powered knowledge assistant that:
* Runs completely offline with no external API calls
* Processes and indexes personal documents locally
* Enables natural language conversations with personal data
* Maintains complete privacy and data control
* Optimized for Replit's containerized environment
Target Users
Primary: Privacy-conscious knowledge workers, researchers, students, and professionals who work with sensitive documents and want offline AI assistance.
Secondary: Teams in regulated industries, remote workers with unreliable internet, and users in regions with data sovereignty requirements.
Key Features & Requirements
Core Features
1. Document Ingestion: Support for text files (.txt, .md, .docx, .pdf) with drag-and-drop upload
2. Local AI Chat: Small language model integration for conversations with your documents
3. Semantic Search: Vector-based document search with relevant context retrieval
4. Privacy-First: Completely offline operation with no external API calls
Technical Architecture
Frontend
* Framework: React with Nextjs, vercel for fast development
* UI Library: Tailwind CSS for rapid styling
* File Upload: React-dropzone for document ingestion
* Chat UI: Custom components with auto-scroll and typing indicators
Backend
* Runtime: Node.js with Express
* AI Model: Ollama integration with Llama 3.2 3B or similar
* Vector Store: ChromaDB or in-memory vector search
* Document Processing: PDF.js, mammoth.js for document parsing
* Embeddings: sentence-transformers via Python bridge or JS equivalent
Data Flow & Architecture Reference
Following the pattern from local-search:
1. Document upload → Text extraction and chunking
2. Local embedding generation → Vector storage
3. Query → Semantic search → Context retrieval
4. LLM response generation → Citation display
Similar to local-search's approach of combining semantic search with local LLMs for private document interaction.
